# Vanquor: A brand new Gamemode
also known as extended freeze tag.

## Concept:
Vanquor introduces an intense PvP experience in Minecraft where players engage in a battle royale-style competition. The core mechanics include a unique respawn system, team-based gameplay, and a shrinking border to intensify the action.

### Respawn Mechanism:

Upon getting killed, players enter a "Fallen" state, preventing them from respawning until the player who defeated them is eliminated.
Fallen players can spectate the ongoing battle, adding a strategic element to the game. If you die without anyone killing you (direct or indirect) the nearest enemie is your killer.
If a player dies the Items don't drop unless in team mode when the whole team is out. After respawn you have all your items but your level is reset and you are back in the center.

### Team Dynamics:

Players are divided into teams, and the objective is to eliminate every member of the opposing teams.
In single-player mode, a player must eliminate every other player to win.

### Gameplay:

You spawn in a circle around the center. There is only 10 seconds of protection time after game start. In the map are Chests and Power-ups. Also hunger is disabled.
Every player gets a few start items: Ender pearl, 64 Concrete blocks (They refill instatly).

### Maps:

They usually start 400 x 400 x 100 and end with 20 x 20 x 10. The maps should be built so it isnt possible to fall into the void.

### Levels, Quests and Coins:

You can earn Coins with quests. With Coins you can get a few advantages like: start boost (speed, jump), reduced ender pearl damage and less damage outside border.
Also you can buy cosmetics like: Start Concrete Color, Particle aura, Name decorations and Chat emotes. In every game you get levels for killing a player (if the player killed others you get more levels) collecting items etc.
With Levels you get speedboost, strenghtboost, jumpboost

### Shrinking Border:

To force player encounters and maintain a dynamic environment, a border gradually shrinks over time.
Players outside the border take damage until they return within its bounds, encouraging movement and confrontation.

### Strategic Elements:

Introduce power-ups or special items that spawn randomly across the map, giving players advantages in battles.
