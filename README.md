# Vanquor: A brand new Gamemode
also known as extended freeze tag.

## Concept:

Vanquor introduces an intense PvP experience in Minecraft where players engage in a battle royale-style competition. The core mechanics include a unique respawn system, team-based gameplay, and a shrinking border to intensify the action.

### Respawn Mechanism:

Upon getting killed, players enter a "Fallen" state, preventing them from respawning until the player who defeated them is eliminated.
Fallen players can spectate the ongoing battle, adding a strategic element to the game. If you die without anyone killing you (direct or indirect) 
your head drops and it can either be collected by an enemie (results in kill) or by an teammate (results in rewive), same applies for disconnect.
If a player dies the Items don't drop unless in team mode when the whole team is out. After respawn you have all your items but your level is reset and you are back in the center.

### Dead Players:

Dead Player can spectate the game but not write in chat or interact with anything. They also win if the team wins.

### Team Dynamics:

Players are divided into teams, and the objective is to eliminate every member of the opposing teams.
In single-player mode, a player must eliminate every other player to win.

### Gameplay:

You spawn in a circle around the center (max 12 in solo, 16 in doubbles, 12 in triples, 16 in quads). There is only 10 seconds of protection time after game start. 
All minute there a random event happens like launch in the air, glow effect, only 5 hearts and randomize inventory sorting. In the map are Chests and Power-ups. Also hunger is disabled.
Every player gets a few start items: Ender pearl, 64 Concrete blocks (They refill instatly, keep them in offhand). After 2 min all players get a glow effect representing the kill count of the player:
Green (no kills..), yellow (1 kill..), red (2 kills..), dark_red (5 kills..), gold (10 kills..)

### Maps:

They usually start 400 x 400 x 100 and end with 20 x 20 x 10. The maps should be built so it isnt possible to fall into the void.

### Levels, Achievements and Coins:

You can earn Coins with achievements. With Coins you can get a few advantages like: start boost (speed, jump), reduced ender pearl damage, more level/coin reward and less damage outside border.
Also you can buy cosmetics like: Start Concrete Color, Particle aura, Name decorations and Chat emotes. 
In every game you get levels for killing a player (if the player killed others you get more levels) (killing a whole team results in an ace and gives doubble the levels) collecting items etc.
With Levels you get speedboost, strenghtboost, jumpboost and others. For evey action to get level ther is a chance to get a small amount of Coins ontop, guaranteed are kills and win.
There are special rewards like at the end: didn't die, whole party didn't die, new kill record and killed a player that killed you.

Achievement are for example get 100 kills, play for 5h or even join 10 times in a day.

### Shrinking Border:

To force player encounters and maintain a dynamic environment, a border gradually shrinks over time.
Players outside the border take damage until they return within its bounds, encouraging movement and confrontation.

### Strategic Elements:

Introduce power-ups or special items that spawn randomly across the map, giving players advantages in battles.

### Others:

Leaderboard: Max Levels (in a game)/Wins/Winstreak/Kills (Player Kill)/Playtime/Games Played (Games Played to finish (won or loss, leaving won't count). Resets every week, top players get coins (you get the most coins from Games Played/Playtime).

Stats: Kills, Wins, Winstreak, Losses, Killed, Coins, Max Level, Games played, Playtime

Party: A party can only have a max of 4 players unless its an admin party (has to be changed by an admin). A party can't que for more or less playermode.

Friends: Can join your party without invite and can be added without invite unless they are already in another party.
Voice chat: mayyyybe.

Ban: You know what you have to do to get banned (100% bans (confirmed by admin and longer then 6 months) reset all your coins/upgrades and stats)
